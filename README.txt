~~ Welcome to Group 10BC's Visualisation Website ~~

    Made by Yavuz Bozkurt, Prayag Joy, Stavros Kannavas, Sander van der Leek, Jeffrey Lint, Rik van Noort & Melih Şengül.

~~ How to use: ~~
    1.  Unzip the Visualisation-Website.zip file and save it in a known location on your computer.
    2.  Inside VSCode open the Visualisation-Website folder and run VisWeb.py with a python interpreter. 
        OR use a terminal to run VisWeb.py with a python interpreter. EX: "python VisWeb.py"
        It is important to make sure the directory path is in the folder Visualisation-Website before running the website. EX: "C:\Users\[username]\Desktop\Visualisation-Website>"
    3.  If you are missing any packages type in the terminal "pip install [packagename]". Repeat this step multiple times if necessary.
        VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure that Bokeh version 1.4.0 is installed!
        If not then type in the terminal "pip uninstall bokeh" and then "pip install bokeh==1.4.0".
    4.  If everything is working you should see in the terminal (among many other lines) the following output:
        "" 
        * Serving Flask app 'VisWeb' (lazy loading)
        * Environment: production
        WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
        Use a production WSGI server instead.
        * Debug mode: on
        * Restarting with stat
        * Debugger is active!

        * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        ""
    5.  Now you can open the website, paste in the searchbar of your internet browser "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" and hit enter. 
    6.  Once you are done go into the terminal and press ctrl+c to close the website.
